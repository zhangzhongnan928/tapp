# Tapps, tokens as apps
# Comparison of Tapps and Dapps

| Aspect | Dapps  | Tapps  |
|--------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Core Object** | Application | Token |
| **Function Provision** | Provided by dapp interface | Provided by token interface |
| **Backend** | Smart contracts and database | Smart contracts and database |
| **Frontend** | Web or app interface | Standardized token interface |
| **Design Flexibility** ðŸ”´ | High flexibility in design/function and UX | Less flexible, but standardized |
| **Trust Model** ðŸŸ¢ | â€¢ Trust starts from website or app<br>â€¢ User remembers a website/app to use functions<br>â€¢ Trust can't be ported to other platforms<br>â€¢ Need to trust new platforms for same function | â€¢ Trust derived from the token itself<br>â€¢ Consistent trust across all platforms<br>â€¢ Only need to trust the token |
| **Integration** ðŸŸ¢ | Difficult to integrate with other platforms | Easily integrated across various platforms |
| **Portability** ðŸŸ¢ | Limited portability, tied to specific interfaces | High portability, functions move with tokens |
| **User Experience** ðŸŸ¢ | â€¢ Same functions, UX may vary between different dapps<br>â€¢ Often requires separate apps/websites | â€¢ Consistent across platforms<br>â€¢ Use functions where you see your token<br>â€¢ No separate apps/websites needed |
| **Rights Representation** ðŸŸ¢ | Limited in representing complex real-world rights | Can represent complex real-world rights |
| **Composability** ðŸŸ¢ | Limited, often requires explicit integrations | High, easily mix and match capabilities |
| **Development** | â€¢ Established ecosystem<br>â€¢ Relatively simple development | â€¢ Emerging technology<br>â€¢ May require more sophisticated development |
| **Security** | Well-established security practices | Potential for new types of vulnerabilities if not implemented properly |
| **Development Time** ðŸŸ¢ | Full development control, but can take a lot of time to set up and manage | Can be configured and running within minutes, with framework providing further time-saving features |
| **Learning Curve**  | Proven to enable chart-topping solutions | Also proven to enable chart-topping solutions (e.g., Smart Cats Polygon, MORCHI Dapp Radar) |

**Key Advantages of Tapps:**

1. **Beyond Financial Tokens:** Tapps can digitize real-world rights, carrying utility logic with the token. This makes them ideal for representing complex assets like event tickets or other property rights.
   
2. **Seamless Experience:** Users can interact with their tapps consistently across platforms, trusting only their token rather than multiple apps or websites.
   
3. **True Portability:** Tapps offer unparalleled portability, with the token's frontend & backend logic tied to the token. Wallet and Dapp developers simply embed the existing logic defined by the token issuer, rather than rewriting that logic themselves. For the user, this provides a consistent experience across all platforms.
   
4. **Built-in Trust:** Tapps provide decentralized reliability through signed code and a decentralized running environment. Trust is derived from the code itself, not intermediaries.
   
5. **Rapid Development:** Tapps can be configured and running within minutes, leveraging the framework to provide time-saving features throughout the development process.
