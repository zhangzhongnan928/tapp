# Comparison of Tapps and Dapps

| Aspect | Dapps  | Tapps  |
|--------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Core Object** | Application | Token |
| **Function Provision** | Provided by dapp interface | Provided by token interface |
| **Backend** | Smart contracts and database | Smart contracts and database |
| **Frontend** | Web or app interface | Standardized token interface |
| **Design Flexibility** ðŸ”´| High flexibility in design/function and UX | Less flexible, but standardized |
| **Trust Model** ðŸŸ¢| â€¢ Trust starts from website or app<br>â€¢ User remembers a website/app to use functions<br>â€¢ Trust can't be ported to other platforms<br>â€¢ Need to trust new platforms for same function | â€¢ Trust derived from the token itself<br>â€¢ Consistent trust across all platforms<br>â€¢ Only need to trust the token |
| **Integration** ðŸŸ¢| Difficult to integrate with other platforms | Easily integrated across various platforms |
| **Portability** ðŸŸ¢| Limited portability, tied to specific interfaces | High portability, functions move with tokens |
| **User Experience** ðŸŸ¢| â€¢ Same functions, UX may vary between different dapps<br>â€¢ Often requires separate apps/websites | â€¢ Consistent across platforms<br>â€¢ Use functions where you see your token<br>â€¢ No separate apps/websites needed |
| **Rights Representation** ðŸŸ¢| Limited in representing complex real-world rights | Can represent complex real-world rights |
| **Composability** ðŸŸ¢| Limited, often requires explicit integrations | High, easily mix and match capabilities |
| **Development** ðŸ”´| â€¢ Established ecosystem<br>â€¢ Relatively simple development | â€¢ Emerging technology<br>â€¢ May require more sophisticated development |
| **Security** ðŸ”´| Well-established security practices | Potential for new types of vulnerabilities if not implemented properly |

**Key Advantages of Tapps:**

1. **Beyond Financial Tokens:** Tapps can digitize real-world rights, carrying utility logic with the token. This makes them ideal for representing complex assets like event tickets or other property rights.

2. **Seamless Experience:** Users can interact with their tapps consistently across platforms, trusting only their token rather than multiple apps or websites.

3. **True Portability:** Tapps offer unparalleled portability, with both backend and frontend moving with the user. This enables integration on the user side rather than the application side.

4. **Built-in Trust:** Tapps provide decentralized reliability through signed code and a decentralized running environment. Trust is derived from the code itself, not intermediaries.
